I have used Thompson sampling algorithm for sampling the arms.
It generates values from a beta distribution with parameters
no of successes + 1 and no of failures + 1.
I calculate these values for every arm and select the arm with maximum value to be the next arm to be pulled.

I have used the beta distribution from the open source gsl library and the command used is gsl_ran_beta (gsl_rng *,double,double);
I get a regret of 12 while running for 5 arms, with Horizon=100, Exploration horizon=0;
I get a regret of 13 while running for 7 arms, with Horizon=100, Exploration horizon=0;
